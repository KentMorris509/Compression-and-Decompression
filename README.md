Description: In this program program we create a text file compression and decompression implementing our own data structure HashTableChain that is an implementation of the HashTable ADT. In doing our compression algorithm we use our HashTableChain to store values setting the table capacity accordingly depending on the size of the file to be compressed to limit the amount of rehashing resulting in less collisions. In our program we test varied ranges of text file sizes in order to show that our program is operating effectively. In our decompression we use a perfect Hash Table to decompress our binary encoded file back into the text file that had been compressed. We made sure to also implement a HashTableChain that could be used for any program, including all the necessary key methods. The program allows the user to rerun both the Compress and Decompress if a invalid file is detected and includes exception catching for invalid files.
